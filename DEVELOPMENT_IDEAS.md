#Future refinement ideas for konte

 - a syntax highlighting editor component using JFlex and RSyntaxTextArea
 - replace old hand written parser with a JFlex parser (if not compromising nice error messages)
 - (v) the light model to include surface inclinations (implemented as PhongLight)
 - a more efficient disk backup of big scenes during the generate phase
 - user defined functions

#Secondary ideas

 - more effects:  brightness and contrast
 - more effects:  mask
