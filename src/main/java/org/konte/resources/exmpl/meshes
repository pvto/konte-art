/*
 =======
  Meshes are lattices of quadrilaterals (here).
  Reserved keywords are:
    mesh (determines the current mesh: floating point, rounded to 1000th)
    row  (determines the current row in a mesh to pile pieces to)
    MESH (call to insert a piece into a lattice)
  There must be at least two rows and two columns,
    otherwise a mesh won't draw.
  There is no integrity check on the number of columns in
    different rows. If you are not careful, some meshes may
    see to be distorted due to this!
